Early Brain Stroke Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the early detection of brain strokes using deep learning techniques applied to CT scan images. Stroke is a major cause of disability and death globally, and early diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming and prone to human error. This project offers a faster and more accurate solution powered by artificial intelligence.

  Project Objective

- Automate the detection of brain strokes from CT scan images  
- Improve accuracy and speed of diagnosis using deep learning  
- Assist radiologists in clinical decision-making with AI support  

  Models Used

- ConvNeXt  
- Swin Transformer  
- ResNet-50  
- DenseNet  

DenseNet achieved the highest accuracy of 99.20 percent. All models performed well, with accuracies ranging between 90 percent and 99.20 percent.

  Dataset

- Type: Binary classification (Normal vs Stroke)  
- Input: CT scan images  
- Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation  

Note: Due to privacy constraints, the dataset is not publicly included. A similar open-source dataset can be used for testing and experimentation.

  Accuracy Results

| Model            | Accuracy (%) |
|------------------|--------------|
| ConvNeXt         | 90.00        |
| Swin Transformer | 94.50        |
| ResNet-50        | 97.30        |
| DenseNet         | 99.20        |

  Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy
